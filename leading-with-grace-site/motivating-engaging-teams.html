  <h1>Motivating &amp; Engaging Teams</h1>
  <p class="tagline">
    Creating conditions where people feel energized, valued, and connected to purpose.
  </p>

  <p>
    Engagement is rarely about posters and slogans; it grows when people feel their work matters and their strengths are
    being used. New leaders sometimes assume that everyone is motivated by the same things that motivate them. Effective
    leadership means paying attention to what fuels each individual, helping them connect their daily work to something
    meaningful, and recognizing effort—not just outcomes.
  </p>

  <!-- Core Practices -->
  <section class="topic-section">
    <h2>Motivating &amp; Engaging Teams</h2>

    <p>
      Employee motivation is not something you do to people—it’s something you help unlock in people. When leaders create
      space for autonomy, growth, recognition, and connection, engagement rises naturally. When clarity, trust, and
      fairness are present, people show up with more energy and ownership.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Learn what energizes each person: recognition, autonomy, learning, stability, or challenge.</li>
      <li>Connect daily tasks to the larger impact on customers, students, or community.</li>
      <li>Offer choices where possible so people feel a sense of ownership.</li>
      <li>Notice and name progress, not just big wins or formal achievements.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Leaders can spark motivation by asking, “What kind of work gives you energy?” or “When do you feel most effective?”
      These small but intentional questions can reveal powerful insights into how someone wants to grow.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Understanding Motivation -->
  <section class="topic-section">
    <h2>Understanding What Drives People</h2>

    <p>
      Even people with similar roles are often motivated by very different factors. Some thrive on challenge; others
      value security. Some respond best to public recognition; others prefer quiet appreciation. Taking time to identify
      what motivates each team member helps you tailor support and increase engagement.
    </p>

    <h3>Questions to Ask in 1:1s</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>“What kind of work excites you or feels most meaningful?”</li>
      <li>“What type of recognition feels most genuine for you?”</li>
      <li>“What kind of projects help you feel like you’re growing?”</li>
      <li>“How do you prefer to receive feedback or encouragement?”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You don’t need to inspire everyone in the same way—you just need to understand what matters most to them.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Engagement Drivers -->
  <section class="topic-section">
    <h2>Key Drivers of Engagement</h2>

    <p>
      While motivation is personal, research shows that most employees tend to engage more when the following elements
      are present:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> They know their work contributes to something that matters.</li>
      <li><strong>Progress:</strong> They see growth over time and receive recognition for effort.</li>
      <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> They have some ownership over how they approach their work.</li>
      <li><strong>Connection:</strong> They trust teammates and feel seen by their leader.</li>
      <li><strong>Competency:</strong> They feel capable and have opportunities to develop new strengths.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Recognition That Works -->
  <section class="topic-section">
    <h2>Recognition That Works</h2>

    <p>
      Recognition is most meaningful when it is specific, timely, and connected to effort or values—not just results.
      Instead of saying, “Good job,” try phrases that highlight impact.
    </p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>“I appreciated how you kept the client updated even when the timeline changed—that level of communication builds trust.”</li>
      <li>“You handled that customer concern with calmness and respect. That reflects our values in action.”</li>
      <li>“That presentation was well structured and clear. You made it easier for the team to take next steps.”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Consistently naming what’s working encourages people to repeat it. It also helps newer leaders shape team culture
      in tangible ways.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Boosting Ownership & Engagement -->
  <section class="topic-section">
    <h2>Boosting Ownership</h2>

    <p>
      People engage more deeply when they feel part of the process, not just the output. Offering small choices—such as
      sequencing a task, selecting a partner, or leading a portion of a meeting—builds confidence and fosters initiative.
    </p>

    <p>
      Try asking: <strong>“How would you like to approach this?”</strong> or <strong>“Is there a way you’d prefer to
      handle this project?”</strong> Small autonomy moments build ownership over time.
