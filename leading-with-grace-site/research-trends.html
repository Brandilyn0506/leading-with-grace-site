  <h1>Research &amp; Trends</h1>
  <p class="tagline">
    Current findings, big-picture trends, and deeper dives for leaders who want to stay informed and intentional.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>Research &amp; Trends</strong> page highlights studies, reports, and perspectives that shape how we think
    about work today—engagement, culture, hybrid work, well-being, and leadership expectations. The goal isn’t to drown
    you in data, but to offer a few carefully selected pieces you can actually use.
  </p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Each resource below includes a brief summary, why it matters, and a reflection or question to bring back to your
    own team. You can use these insights to sharpen strategy, support your people, or simply frame better conversations
    about how you work together.
  </p>

  <!-- Current Findings & Trends -->
  <div class="research-grid">

    <article class="insight-card">
      <p class="insight-category">Current Findings</p>
      <h3>Global Engagement &amp; Well-Being</h3>
      <p class="insight-meta">Source: Gallup – State of the Global Workplace</p>
      <p>
        Gallup’s ongoing research tracks how people feel about their work, their stress levels, and whether they feel
        their opinions count. The reports highlight gaps between engaged and disengaged employees and the critical role
        of the manager.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Engagement is not just a “nice-to-have.” It’s tied to performance,
        retention, and how people talk about your organization outside the building.</p>
      <p><strong>Reflect:</strong> If you asked your team how they’re doing right now, what do you think they would say—
        and how do you know?</p>

      <h3>The Evolving Workforce &amp; Human Sustainability</h3>
      <p class="insight-meta">Source: Deloitte – Global Human Capital Trends</p>
      <p>
        Deloitte’s research explores how organizations are rethinking work, skills, and leadership—moving from simple
        productivity metrics toward “human sustainability” and long-term capability building.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Leaders are expected to deliver results and protect the people who deliver
        them. Ignoring well-being and development has real costs over time.</p>
      <p><strong>Try this:</strong> Choose one policy, process, or habit and ask: “Does this help or hinder people’s
        ability to do great work over the long term?”</p>

      <h3>How Work Is Changing (and What Leaders Can Do)</h3>
      <p class="insight-meta">Source: McKinsey &amp; Company – Future of Work &amp; Organizations</p>
      <p>
        McKinsey’s organizational research highlights shifts in technology, hybrid work, skills, and leadership models.
        It emphasizes adaptability, clarity of purpose, and the need for leaders who can make decisions amid ambiguity.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The context you’re leading in is changing whether you plan for it or not.
        Understanding the larger landscape helps you make grounded, forward-looking decisions.</p>
      <p><strong>Reflect:</strong> Where is your team already adapting well, and where are you still using “old rules”
        for a new reality?</p>

      <p class="insight-category">Trust &amp; Reputation</p>
      <h3>Trust in Leaders &amp; Institutions</h3>
      <p class="insight-meta">Source: Edelman – Trust Barometer</p>
      <p>
        Edelman’s annual Trust Barometer examines how much people trust business, government, media, and NGOs—and where
        leaders are expected to step in on social and workplace issues. Business often emerges as the most trusted
        institution, raising the bar on leaders’ responsibilities.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Trust is a leadership asset you build slowly and lose quickly. Understanding
        what builds (or erodes) trust helps you lead with steadiness and credibility.</p>
      <p><strong>Try this:</strong> Ask yourself: “If someone looked only at my actions over the last month, would they
        see reasons to trust my words?”</p>
