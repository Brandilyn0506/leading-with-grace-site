  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>Leadership Articles</strong> page gathers trusted, research-based pieces on topics such as emotional
    intelligence, manager effectiveness, listening, and human-centered performance. Each article below includes a short

  </p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    These articles are selected to support leaders who want to grow in both character and competence. As you read,
    consider how each idea connects to your current role, your team, or a specific situation you’re navigating.

      <h3>What Makes a Leader?</h3>
      <p class="insight-meta">Source: Harvard Business Review · Focus: Emotional Intelligence</p>
      <p>
        Daniel Goleman explains why emotional intelligence matters as much as IQ and technical skill in effective
        leadership. He highlights five components: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skill.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Leaders who understand and manage themselves are better able to build trust,
        navigate conflict, and guide others through change without losing connection.</p>
      <p><strong>Reflect:</strong> Which part of emotional intelligence is a strength for you right now, and which one
        needs more intentional practice this season?</p>

      <h3>Engage Your Workforce by Empowering Your Managers First</h3>
      <p class="insight-meta">Source: Gallup · Focus: Manager Effectiveness &amp; Engagement</p>
      <p>
        Gallup shares research showing that engaged managers are the key to engaged teams. The article explores the
        pressures managers face and how clarity, coaching, and realistic expectations directly influence performance and retention.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Most employees experience the organization through their direct manager. When
        managers are supported and aligned, the whole team benefits.</p>
      <p><strong>Try this:</strong> Think of one manager you support. What is one conversation, resource, or boundary
        that would make their role more sustainable?</p>

      <h3>Active Listening Techniques: Best Practices for Leaders</h3>
      <p class="insight-meta">Source: Center for Creative Leadership · Focus: Listening &amp; Coaching</p>
      <p>
        The Center for Creative Leadership outlines concrete listening skills—like reflecting, clarifying, and
        summarizing—that help leaders turn everyday conversations into coaching moments.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Many leadership challenges are really listening challenges. When people feel
        heard, they are more open to feedback, direction, and change.</p>
      <p><strong>Try this:</strong> In your next 1:1, aim to listen long enough that you can summarize the other
        person’s perspective before offering your own.</p>

      <h3>The Mindsets and Practices of Excellent CEOs</h3>
      <p class="insight-meta">Source: McKinsey &amp; Company · Focus: Senior Leadership &amp; Strategy</p>
      <p>
        McKinsey identifies recurring mindsets and routines among highly effective CEOs, including how they set
        direction, align the organization, work with the board, and manage their own time and energy.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Even if you’re not a CEO, these patterns provide a helpful picture of
        accountable, long-horizon leadership.</p>
      <p><strong>Reflect:</strong> Which mindset described in the article feels most applicable to your level of
        responsibility right now?</p>

      <h3>Evolving Leadership to Drive Human Performance</h3>
      <p class="insight-meta">Source: Deloitte · Focus: Human-Centered Leadership</p>
      <p>
        Deloitte explores how leaders can move beyond traditional productivity metrics to focus on “human performance”
        — creating conditions where people can do meaningful, sustainable work over time.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Lasting performance requires more than tasks and targets. Leaders shape the
        pace, priorities, and practices that either fuel or drain their teams.</p>
      <p><strong>Try this:</strong> Choose one initiative or priority and ask, “How does this impact people’s ability
        to do their best work long-term?” Adjust one expectation accordingly.</p>
