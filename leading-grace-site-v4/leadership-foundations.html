  <h1>Leadership Foundations</h1>
  <p class="tagline">
    Core practices that help new managers lead with both compassion and conviction.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stepping into leadership changes how you see your work, your decisions, and your relationships. The
    <strong>Leadership Foundations</strong> section focuses on three essentials for new managers:
    leading with grace and truth, building trust and respect, and communicating with clarity. These are not
    one-time skills to “check off,” but ongoing practices you grow into over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    As you explore each section, consider where you already feel confident and where you might need new habits,
    language, or support. Foundations are built slowly—one conversation, one decision, and one follow-through at a time.
  </p>

  <!-- Leading with Grace & Truth -->
  <section class="topic-section">
    <h2>Leading with Grace &amp; Truth</h2>

    <p>
      New managers are often pulled between being kind and being clear. This section explores how grace and truth
      work together rather than compete with each other. Grace shows up as patience, curiosity, and care for the
      person. Truth shows up as honesty about expectations, priorities, and impact.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you lead with both, people experience you as steady and trustworthy: you are willing to have hard
      conversations, but you do so in a way that honors their dignity. Grace without truth can feel comforting but
      confusing. Truth without grace can feel efficient but harsh. Healthy leadership requires both.
    </p>

    <h3>Everyday Ways to Lead with Grace &amp; Truth</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Show empathy without avoiding hard conversations.</li>
      <li>Share expectations early so people are not surprised later.</li>
      <li>Use phrases that balance support and clarity, such as “I care about you and…”.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You can think of grace and truth as two questions you carry into every interaction:
      <strong>“How can I care well for this person?”</strong> and <strong>“What do they need to clearly understand?”</strong>
      Checking both boxes helps you stay grounded when you’re tempted to either soften too much or “go blunt.”
    </p>

    <h3>Reflection Prompts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>“Where have I chosen comfort over clarity in a recent conversation?”</li>
      <li>“Where have I delivered truth but forgotten to show care?”</li>
      <li>“What is one phrase I can use this week that starts with ‘I care about you and…’?”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I will add additional models, examples, and a downloadable reflection guide for this core framework here.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Building Trust & Respect -->
  <section class="topic-section">
    <h2>Building Trust &amp; Respect</h2>

    <p>
      Trust is built slowly through small, consistent actions. For many new leaders, the shift from “co-worker”
      to “manager” can make relationships feel uncertain. This section focuses on predictable habits that help
      people feel safe working with you.
    </p>

    <p>
      People watch what you do more closely once you become a leader. They notice how you handle stress, how you talk
      about others, and whether your decisions line up with what you say you value. Respect is rarely demanded—it is
      earned through how you show up day after day.
    </p>

    <h3>Trust-Building Behaviors</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Do what you say you will do, even with small commitments.</li>
      <li>Explain the “why” behind decisions whenever possible.</li>
      <li>Give credit publicly and coach privately.</li>
      <li>Admit mistakes and share what you are learning.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Trust also grows when people experience you as predictable in your character, even if circumstances are changing.
      That means you are not kind one day and dismissive the next, or clear one moment and vague the next. Consistency
      gives your team the confidence to bring you both good news and hard news.
    </p>

    <h3>Practical Trust Routines</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Open 1:1s with, “Is there anything you need from me that you’re not getting?”</li>
      <li>Close team meetings by summarizing decisions and who is responsible for what.</li>
      <li>Regularly highlight team wins and name who contributed.</li>
      <li>When something goes wrong, start with, “Help me understand what happened,” instead of assigning blame.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I will add information regarding specific trust-building routines and sample one-on-one questions here.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Communicating with Clarity -->
  <section class="topic-section">
    <h2>Communicating with Clarity</h2>

    <p>
      Clear communication reduces anxiety and rework. For new managers, clarity often means slowing down long enough
      to check for understanding and invite questions. This section highlights simple structures you can apply to
      meetings, emails, and coaching conversations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clarity doesn’t mean using more words—it means using the right ones. When people understand the purpose, the
      priorities, and what is expected of them, they can focus their energy on doing great work instead of guessing.
    </p>

    <h3>Foundations of Clear Communication</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use plain language and avoid unnecessary jargon.</li>
      <li>Organize messages around: purpose, key points, and next steps.</li>
      <li>Ask team members to repeat back key actions in their own words.</li>
      <li>Follow up in writing after important decisions or commitments.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A simple pattern you can use is: <strong>Why</strong> (why this matters),
      <strong>What</strong> (what is happening or changing), and <strong>How</strong>
      (how it affects the team and what they need to do). This works in emails, team huddles, and
      one-on-one conversations.
    </p>

    <h3>Questions to Check for Understanding</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>“What are you taking away as your top priorities from this conversation?”</li>
      <li>“What feels clear, and what still feels fuzzy?”</li>
      <li>“If you had to explain this plan to someone else, how would you describe it?”</li>
    </ul>
